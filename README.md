## Mar 6 Data Science Tutorial - Bag of Words Model for Computerized Applicant Screening

We will be modifying a kaggle.com code notebook to demonstrate the bag of words model. The code is open source and you can use it for your own projects.  

1. Create a kaggle.com account.

2. Go to #to-do: share notebook.

3. Fork #to-do: share notebook.

4. Run the cells in the notebook using shift-enter.

5. Discuss, brainstorm, modify the code on your own machine and together.

## Optional - general Python Tutorial if you like

1. ~/$ mkdir dir

2. ~/$ cd dir

3. ~/mar6$ pip install jupyter

4. ~/mar6$ jupyter notebook

5. In the top right-hand corner of your jupyter notebook browser window, click 'new'->Python [conda env:py27] to open and run your own notebook.

6. Go 'home' to open and run the 'Upper Valley Data Scientists Python Tutorial'.

7. You can run the cells by clicking within them, editing them to your liking to try things out, and pressing shift-enter.

8. You can save your progress in your new notebook, if you choose to do some testing of Python out over there.

9. And you can download your noteboook from the file menu as well. 

This tutorial uses  modules, comments, print, arithmetic operators, order of operation, lists, tuples, dictionaries, conditional operators, logical operators, if, else, elif, loops, for, while, break, continue, functions, return, readline(), string operators, file i/o, objects, and classes. 

## Optional - a few data science techniques in R if you like

1. Download RStudio 1.0.136 - https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ 
2. Download R-3.3.2 - https://cran.cnr.berkeley.edu/ 

3. Install.

4. Open Upper+Valley+Data+Scientists+R+Tutorial.R in RStudio.

4. You can open and run your own R script. File -> New File -> R Script.

5. You can select individual lines and run them. Code -> Run Selected Line(s).

6. And you can save your script from the file menu.

This tutorial uses functions, classes (identify the type of an object), linear regression, multiple linear regression, and PCA.
